Synthesis of New Samples:\n","For generating a synthetic sample, SMOTE chooses one of the k-nearest neighbors and computes a vector in feature space that connects the selected sample to its neighbor. A new sample is then synthesized along this line. Specifically, it takes the difference between the feature vector of the randomly chosen sample and its nearest neighbor, multiplies this difference by a random number between 0 and 1, and then adds it back to the feature vector of the chosen sample."],"metadata":{"id":"fv0SHsvfk-AH"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\n","\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"zqEo7irmkHrm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"vO2qQg-kjUg3"},"outputs":[],"source":["# This script assumes that you have loaded your data and instatiated the variables: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test\n","# using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection.
